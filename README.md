## 📝 What is rbxfpsunlocker?

rbxfpsunlocker is a simple tool that helps you increase the frames per second (FPS) limit in Roblox games. Many Roblox games set a low FPS limit by default, which can make your gameplay feel choppy or less smooth. This program removes that limit, letting you play with smoother motion on capable computers.

If you enjoy Roblox and want it to run more smoothly on your PC, this tool is for you. It works quietly in the background and does not require any programming skills to use.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11 (64-bit recommended)
- Roblox installed on your computer
- At least 4 GB of RAM
- A video card that supports OpenGL 3.0 or higher
- Internet connection to download the software

Your PC does not need to be high-end. The unlocker focuses mainly on removing software limits Roblox sets on FPS. However, having a decent graphics card will help you see the biggest improvement.
